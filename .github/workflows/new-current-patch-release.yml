  # Patching current stable version is basically merging commits from main to release branch
  # Since we ensure main is compatible with 3.22, instead of cherry-picking and porting, we
  # just branch from main to current stable and create a release candidate. On this branch we run tests
  # and release changelogs and tags.
  # This workflow is automating this and ensuring branch protection is omitted for authorized actor.
