# Running E2E tests

The dashboard uses Playwright for running E2E tests.

> [!NOTE]
> The tests are based on Saleor Cloud and use snapshots with prepared data.
> If you want to run those tests on your infrastructure you should update test data with your own created objects
> https://github.com/saleor/saleor-dashboard/blob/main/playwright/data/e2eTestData.ts and make sure to create snapshot.
