Move order metadata editing to dedicated dialog with improved UX. Order metadata is now edited via a button in the header that opens a modal dialog, replacing the previous inline card below transactions. Added ripple indicator to highlight the new feature location. Also introduced order line metadata dialog for editing metadata at the line item level.
