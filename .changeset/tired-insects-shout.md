Added support for `SINGLE_REFERENCE` attribute types.

When creating new attributes "Single reference" option can be now selected along with entity types (i.e. Product, Product variant, Model, etc.).

Assigning values to `SINGLE_REFERENCE` works similar to `REFERENCE` attributes, except the UI allows to select only a single item.
