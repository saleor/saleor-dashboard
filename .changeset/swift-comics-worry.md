"saleor-dashboard": patch

Redesigned product availability panel with built-in diagnostics. The new panel identifies configuration issues preventing purchase (missing prices, no stock, inactive channels) and includes a "Test" button to verify actual storefront visibility via the public API. Scheduling for publication and availability dates is now supported directly in the panel.
