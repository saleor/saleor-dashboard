Introduced a redesigned "Order summary" section that unifies order details and payment information across all order types, including Drafts and Unconfirmed orders. The updated "Order value" breakdown now clearly separates subtotal, taxes, discounts, and shipping. Additionally, a new "Payments summary" section has been added, featuring a dedicated "no data" state when no payments are present.
