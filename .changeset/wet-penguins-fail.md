Removed "go back" arrow in App view, where app is mounted. 

This arrow caused a confusion between Dashboard navigation and App internal navigation. 
Now, to go back to the Apps List, the side navigation must be used. 

The "Manage App" view was not changed - arrow is still displayed to navigate back to the App Page.
