Replace an Apps section with a new Extensions section visible under a feature flag
New Extensions section is split into two pages:
1. Main Extensions page which presents a list of all installed apps
2. Explore page which presents a list of available apps to install

Currently, Extensions show only apps but in the future Extensions section will gather also plugins and webhooks (custom apps).
