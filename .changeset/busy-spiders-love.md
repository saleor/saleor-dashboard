Narrow down reference attribute choices.

Now you can narrow down reference attribute options by providing:

- Product types for product and product variant references
- Model types for model references

If reference types are defined, then when specifying a value for a reference (product, product variant, or page view), only objects that match the allowed reference types will be available as selectable options.
