"saleor-dashboard": patch

Redesigned toast notifications for better user experience:

- **Notifications now stack compactly** instead of flooding the screen
- **Refined visual design** that's less disruptive and better aligned with the dashboard aesthetic
- **Long messages expand on hover** with "Show more/less" toggle instead of being truncated
- **Error notifications persist** until manually dismissed

**Next up:** Refining notification message copy for clarity and consistency across the dashboard.
