Improve order details datagrid visual polish

Enhanced the visual appearance of order details datagrids with the following improvements:

- Refined column selection styling to use a more subtle hover color, creating a cleaner visual experience when selecting columns
- Improved fulfillment card spacing by making the last card's bottom border white, providing better visual separation from surrounding content
- Fixed visual clutter by hiding the drag handle icon on the empty spacing column
- Added left padding and adjusted spacing for better content alignment
- Enhanced draft order cards with subtle shadows for improved depth perception
- Refined font sizing for better readability

These changes improve the overall visual consistency and polish of the order management interface.
