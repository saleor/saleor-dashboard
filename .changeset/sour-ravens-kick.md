Released changes to Extensions previously behind dev feature flag:

- **Unified "Installed Extensions" view**: Apps, plugins and custom apps (aka "local" apps) are now listed together on a single "Installed Extensions" page.
- **Plugins in "Explore Extensions"**: Legacy plugins are now discoverable in the "Explore Extensions" section.
- **Redesigned "Add Custom App" Workflow**: Creating custom apps is now a multi-step process, starting with name and permissions, followed by webhook and token configuration.
- **Streamlined "Install from Manifest"**: Providing a manifest URL and accepting app permissions are now combined into a single page.
- **Improved error handling**: Error messages now include direct links to Saleor Documentation for easier troubleshooting.
- **Removed old views**: Separate list views for plugins and custom apps have been removed.
